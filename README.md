First attempt at a public repository

I automate everything.  My right hand is Python and my left hand is Angular.  
Automation started with X-10 modules, then the Home Control Ap offered by X-10
during the Windows XP era. (Ah what an OS. Tried Windows 1, threw it out, tried 2,
threw it out, played with 3.0, worked with 3.1 and fell in love with XP)

Now automation is wildly out of control using Alexa, Arduino and all kinds
of ethernet controlled devices.

Fell in love with Git when I picked up Angular 1 and used Netbeans for the IDE.
